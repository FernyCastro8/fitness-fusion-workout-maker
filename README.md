## Description

A site Retrieving date from ``service side API using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Tailwind(framework), and NinjaAPI!``
On this site users can find exercises based on their experience level, type of training, and there select muscle group. The site takes in three user inputs and pulls data from the ExerciseAPI that matches their selection, if the user doesn't have an exact preference on muscle group, experience level, and training type, they can select one button to find specific workouts matching their choice. We also added a QuoteAPI to pull a randomized inspirational quote followed by the author of the quotes name.
